    "changelog": "### New features\n* The global network simulator (configurable through `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkSimulatorParameters`) now supports delay, jitter and packet duplication, but only in the send direction. Currently users are still recommended to use the `SimulatorPipelineStage` for their network simulation needs until the global network simulator gains in maturity.\n\n### Changes\n* Updated Burst dependency to 1.8.12.\n\n### Fixes\n* Fixed an issue where `NetworkEndpoint.IsAny` and `NetworkEndpoint.IsLoopback` would throw an exception for endpoints where the network family is `NetworkFamily.Custom`. These properties will now return false for custom endpoints.\n* Fixed an issue where an error about resetting the event queue with pending events could be logged even if the connection with pending events was closed.\n* Made the failure mode more obvious when there is a mismatch between the Relay configuration and the choice of network interface.\n* Fixed a rare issue where a sequence ID collision from ushort overflow in certain very specific conditions can result in an old packet being erroneously returned instead of waiting for a new one, causing corruption."
